Day 1: Basics of Networking & Models

Topics:
         🔹What is Computer Network, its types (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN)

            👉 A computer network is a collection of two or more interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) that communicate with each other to share data, resources, and services.
                
                 1. PAN (Personal Area Network)

                    📌Smallest network, ek individual ke around hota hai.
                    📌Range: 1 to 10 meters.
                    📌Devices: Smartphone, Laptop, Bluetooth earphones, Smartwatch.

                    Example: Tumhara mobile hotspot ya Bluetooth headphone connection.

                2. LAN (Local Area Network)

                    📌Ek limited geographical area (office, home, school) ka network.
                    📌High speed (100 Mbps – 1 Gbps).
                    📌Managed by a single organization.
                    📌Devices: Computers, Printers, Switches, Routers.

                    Example: Office Wi-Fi network, College lab network.

                3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

                    📌LAN se bada, ek city level ka network.
                    📌Connects multiple LANs within a city.
                    📌Range: 5–50 km.

                    Example: Cable TV network, City-wide Wi-Fi (like Bhopal Smart City Wi-Fi).

                4. WAN (Wide Area Network)

                    📌Sabse bada network — covers countries/continents.
                    📌Connects multiple LANs and MANs.
                    📌Internet itself is the largest WAN.

                    Example: Banking network across India, Internet.


         🔹Topologies (Bus, Star, Mesh, Hybrid)

            👉 Network topology is the arrangement of devices (nodes) and cables in a network.
                It shows how devices are connected and how data flows between them.

                    Types of Network Topologies

                        1.Bus Topology = One main cable (backbone) connects all devices.
                        If the backbone fails → whole network fails.
                        ✅ Cheap & simple
                        ❌ Slow with many devices
                        📌 Example: Cable TV network

                        2.Star Topology= All devices connect to a central hub/switch.
                        If hub fails → network fails.
                        ✅ Easy to manage
                        ❌ Costly (extra hub/switch)
                        📌 Example: Office Wi-Fi (router in center)

                        3.Mesh Topology= Every device connects to every other device.
                        ✅ Very reliable & fast
                        ❌ Very costly & complex
                        📌 Example: Internet backbone

                        4.Hybrid Topology= Combination of two or more topologies.
                        ✅ Flexible & scalable
                        ❌ Expensive & complex
                        📌 Example: Large company networks


         🔹OSI Model – 7 layers & responsibilities

             👉 It’s a conceptual model that explains how data travels from one device to another in 7 layers.Each layer has its own role.

Day 2: Physical Layer & Data Link Layer

Topics:

        🔹Transmission media (wired, wireless)
          
          👉 Transmission media = the path or channel through which data travels from one device to another in a network.
          It is like a road for data signals.
          Two main types:
            1.Wired (Guided Media)
            2.Wireless (Unguided Media)

            1. Wired (Guided) Transmission Media
                👉 Data travels through physical cables.

                Types:
                1.Twisted Pair Cable
                Copper wires twisted together.
                Used in LAN, telephones.
                📌 Example: Ethernet cables (Cat5, Cat6).

                2.Coaxial Cable
                Single copper wire with shielding.
                Better than twisted pair in noise resistance.
                📌 Example: Cable TV, CCTV.

                3. Optical Fiber Cable
                Uses light signals for transmission.
                Very fast, long distance, secure.
                📌 Example: Internet backbone, ISPs.

                ✅ Advantages:
                High speed (especially fiber).
                Less interference.

                ❌ Disadvantages:
                Installation cost is high.
                Limited mobility.


            2. Wireless (Unguided) Transmission Media
                👉 Data travels through air using electromagnetic waves.
                    Types:
                    1. Radio Waves
                    Travel in all directions.

                    Point-to-point communication.
                    Used in satellites & mobile communication.
                    📌 Example: Mobile towers, satellite TV.

                    3. Infrared (IR)
                    Short distance, line-of-sight.
                    📌 Example: TV remote, short-range devices.

                    4. Satellite Communication
                    Uses satellites to transmit signals.
                    📌 Example: GPS, DTH TV.

                    ✅ Advantages:
                    No physical cables needed.
                    High mobility & easy installation.

                    ❌ Disadvantages:
                    Slower than fiber optics.
                    Can be affected by weather, interference.


        🔹Switching (circuit, packet, message)
            👉 Switching is the method used to route data from source to destination in a network.
            It determines how data packets are forwarded.
                              or
            Switching = The process of transferring data from source to destination in a network using different techniques.
            It decides how data will travel through the network.
    
                Types of Switching:
    
                    1.Circuit Switching
                    A dedicated communication path is established between sender and receiver for the entire duration of the session.
                    📌 Example: Traditional telephone networks.
                    ✅ Advantages:
                    Consistent connection, low latency.
                    ❌ Disadvantages:
                    Inefficient use of resources, setup time.
    
                    2.Packet Switching
                    Data is broken into packets, each packet can take different routes to the destination.
                    📌 Example: The Internet.
                    ✅ Advantages:
                    Efficient use of bandwidth, robust.
                    ❌ Disadvantages:
                    Variable latency, packet loss possible.
    
                    3.Message Switching
                    Entire message is sent to an intermediate node which stores it and forwards it when the next node is free.
                    📌 Example: Email systems.
                    ✅ Advantages:
                    No dedicated path needed, good for large messages.
                    ❌ Disadvantages:
                    Delay due to store-and-forward, requires storage at nodes.  

        🔹Error detection & correction (Parity, CRC, Checksum, Hamming code)

            👉 Error detection and correction are techniques used to ensure data integrity during transmission.
            They help identify and fix errors that may occur due to noise, interference, or other issues in the communication channel.
    
                1. Parity Check
                Adds a single parity bit to data to make the number of 1s either even (even parity) or odd (odd parity).
                📌 Example: 1011001 (odd parity) → 10110011 (parity bit added).
                ✅ Simple and fast.
                ❌ Can only detect single-bit errors.
    
                2. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
                Uses polynomial division to generate a checksum based on the data bits.
                The receiver performs the same calculation to check for errors.
                📌 Example: Used in network protocols like Ethernet.
                ✅ Very reliable for detecting burst errors.
                ❌ More complex than parity check.
    
                3. Checksum
                Adds up all data bytes and sends the sum along with the data.
                The receiver calculates the sum again to verify integrity.
                📌 Example: Used in TCP/IP protocols.
                ✅ Simple and effective for small data blocks.
                ❌ Less effective for large data blocks.
    
                4. Hamming Code
                Adds multiple parity bits at specific positions in the data to allow both error detection and correction.
                📌 Example: Used in computer memory systems.
                ✅ Can detect and correct single-bit errors.
                ❌ More overhead due to extra bits.

        🔹Flow control protocols (Stop-and-wait, Sliding window)
            👉 Flow control protocols manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
    
                1. Stop-and-Wait Protocol
                The sender sends one frame and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next frame.
                📌 Example: Simple file transfer protocols.
                ✅ Simple to implement.
                ❌ Inefficient for long-distance communication due to waiting time.
    
                2. Sliding Window Protocol
                The sender can send multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment, up to a specified window size.
                The receiver can also accept multiple frames and send cumulative ACKs.
                📌 Example: TCP uses sliding window for reliable data transfer.
                ✅ More efficient than Stop-and-Wait, better utilization of bandwidth.
                ❌ More complex to implement due to managing window size and ACKs.

        🔹MAC, ARP, Ethernet basics
            1. MAC (Media Access Control)
                👉 MAC is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer.
                It is used to identify devices on a local network.
                📌 Example: MAC address of a laptop’s Wi-Fi adapter (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
    
            2. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
                👉 ARP is a protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local network.
                When a device wants to communicate with another device, it uses ARP to find the MAC address associated with the target IP address.
                📌 Example: If your computer wants to send data to a printer on the same network, it uses ARP to find the printer's MAC address.    

            3. Ethernet Basics
                👉 Ethernet is a widely used LAN technology that defines wiring and signaling standards for the physical layer

Related Questions For Interview for Day 2:

        1. What is the difference between circuit switching and packet switching?
        2. Explain Stop-and-Wait vs Sliding Window protocol.


        3. How does ARP work? 
         👉 ARP is used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local network by broadcasting an ARP request and receiving an ARP reply.


        4. What is the role of the Data Link Layer?
         👉 The Data Link Layer is responsible for node-to-node delivery of data within the same network. It ensures that data is transferred reliably and without errors from one device to another device directly connected in a LAN.


        5. Explain CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA.
                1. CSMA = Carrier Sense Multiple Access
                     🔹A media access control protocol that decides when a device can transmit data over a shared channel.
                     🔹Devices first listen to the channel before sending data (Carrier Sense).
                     🔹Multiple devices may access the same channel (Multiple Access).

                Now the difference comes in collision handling 👇

                🔹CSMA/CD (Collision Detection) :

                Full form: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
                Used in: Wired Ethernet (LANs)
                How it works:
                       - Device checks if channel is free.
                       - If free → it sends data.
                       - If two devices send at the same time → collision occurs.
                       - Devices detect collision (by monitoring signals).
                       - They stop transmission, wait for a random time (backoff), and try again.

                ✅ Advantage → Works well in wired networks where collisions can be detected.
                ❌ Disadvantage → Wastes bandwidth when collisions happen.
                📌 Example: Classic Ethernet (Hub-based LAN).

                🔹CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance):

                Full form: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
                Used in: Wireless networks (Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11)
                How it works:

                       - Device checks if channel is free.
                       - Instead of transmitting immediately, it waits a random backoff time.
                       - Uses control signals like RTS (Request to Send) / CTS (Clear to Send) to avoid collisions.
                       - Then sends the data safely.

                ✅ Advantage → Prevents collisions (important in wireless where detection is hard).
                ❌ Disadvantage → Extra overhead (RTS/CTS exchange).
                📌 Example: Wi-Fi networks.





Day 3: Network Layer (Part 1)

Topics:

     🔹IP Addressing (IPv4, IPv6)
        👉 An IP address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique number assigned to each device on a network to identify it and enable communication.
        It works at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

            1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
            Size: 32-bit address (divided into 4 octets).
            Format: Decimal, separated by dots → 192.168.1.1
            Total addresses: ~4.3 billion (2³²).
            Address classes: A, B, C, D, E.

            Example: 172.16.0.5

            ✅ Pros: Widely used, simple.
            ❌ Cons: Address exhaustion (not enough IPs).

     🔹Subnetting & Supernetting
       👉 Subnetting = Splitting a large network into smaller sub-networks (subnets).
        It helps in efficient IP address usage and better security & management.
            Uses Subnet Mask to divide the network.

            Example: 192.168.1.0/24 → split into 4 subnets (/26).

            192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63
            192.168.1.64 – 192.168.1.127
            192.168.1.128 – 192.168.1.191
            192.168.1.192 – 192.168.1.255

            ✅ Advantages:
            Reduces broadcast traffic.
            Improves security (isolation).
            Efficient IP utilization.

            📌 Real-life analogy: Dividing a big apartment building into floors and flats → easier management.

    🔹 Supernetting (CIDR – Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

        👉 Supernetting = Combining multiple smaller networks into a larger network.
        It helps in reducing routing table size.
            Opposite of Subnetting.

            Example: Combine 4 networks:

            192.168.0.0/24
            192.168.1.0/24
            192.168.2.0/24
            192.168.3.0/24
            → Single Supernet: 192.168.0.0/22

            ✅ Advantages:
            Fewer routing table entries (aggregation).
            Efficient routing in ISPs.

            📌 Real-life analogy: Clubbing 4 flats into a duplex home → single management unit.

     🔹Routing basics (static vs dynamic routing)
        👉 Routing = The process of finding the best path for data packets to travel from source to destination across networks.
        It happens at the Network Layer (Layer 3) using IP addresses.
        Routers use routing tables to make decisions.


            🔹 Types of Routing
                    1. Static Routing:
                    Routes are manually configured by the network administrator.
                    They don’t change automatically.

                    ✅ Advantages:
                    Simple, secure, no extra overhead.
                    Useful in small networks.

                    ❌ Disadvantages:
                    Not scalable (hard to manage in large networks).
                    If a link fails, route must be changed manually.

                    📌 Example: Small office LAN, lab setup.

                    2. Dynamic Routing:
                    Routes are automatically learned and updated using routing protocols.
                    Routers exchange information to find the best path.

                    ✅ Advantages:
                    Adapts to network changes (failure recovery).
                    Scalable for large networks.

                    ❌ Disadvantages:
                    Complex setup.
                    Requires more resources (CPU, bandwidth).

                    📌 Example: Internet backbone, ISP networks.

                    🔹 Routing Protocols (for Dynamic Routing)
                    1.Distance Vector – RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
                    2.Link State – OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
                    3.Hybrid – EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).
                    4.Exterior Gateway Protocol – BGP (Border Gateway Protocol, used on the Internet).

    Key Difference Table:

    | Feature       | **Static Routing**       | **Dynamic Routing**             |
    | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
    | Configuration | Manual                   | Automatic via routing protocols |
    | Adaptability  | Doesn’t adapt to changes | Adapts automatically to changes |
    | Complexity    | Simple                   | Complex                         |
    | Scalability   | Small networks           | Large networks                  |
    | Example Use   | Small LAN                | Internet / ISP backbone         |




     🔹Routing algorithms (Distance Vector, Link State)
        Routing algorithms decide the best path for data packets to travel in a network. Two main categories:

            🔹 1. Distance Vector Routing
            👉 Each router shares its routing table (distance to other networks) with its neighbors periodically.
            Uses hop count as metric (distance).
            Routers know only about their neighbors, not the whole network.
            Woks slowly to converge (because updates spread step by step).

            ✅ Advantages:
            Simple and easy to implement.

            ❌ Disadvantages:
            Slow convergence, prone to routing loops.

            📌 Examples:
            RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
            IGRP

            🔹 2. Link State Routing
            👉 Each router collects info about the entire network topology and independently calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
            Sends updates only when a change occurs (not periodically).
            Each router builds a map of the whole network.
            Faster and more reliable than Distance Vector.

            ✅ Advantages:
            Fast convergence, loop-free.
            Better for large networks.

            ❌ Disadvantages:
            More complex, needs more memory and CPU.

            📌 Examples:
            OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
            IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
