📅 React Interview Prep Schedule (Day-by-Day)
-------------------------
| Day 1: Basics of React |
-------------------------
Topics:
    🔹What is React? Why use it?
        📌React is a JavaScript library (not a full framework) created by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).
        📌It allows developers to build reusable UI components and handle dynamic updates efficiently.

        Why it’s popular:
        📌Component-Based Architecture → Reusable, maintainable code.
        📌Virtual DOM → Efficient UI updates with minimal re-rendering.
        📌Strong Ecosystem → Huge community, rich libraries, and tools.
        📌Learning Curve → Easier than full frameworks (like Angular).
        📌Backed by Meta (Facebook) → Long-term support and improvements.

    🔹Virtual DOM & Real DOM
        | Feature          | Real DOM                                         | Virtual DOM                                                 |
        | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
        | **Definition**   | The actual Document Object Model in the browser. | A lightweight JavaScript copy of the Real DOM.              |
        | **Update Speed** | Slow (repaints entire tree on changes).          | Fast (updates only changed nodes).                          |
        | **Performance**  | Inefficient for frequent UI updates.             | Efficient due to **diffing algorithm** + **batch updates**. |
        | **Usage**        | Used by browser directly.                        | Used by React internally.                                   |
        | **Example**      | Changing a list item re-renders the entire list. | Only the changed item is re-rendered.                       |


    🔹JSX
        JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

        Example:
        📌const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

        Without JSX, you’d write:
        📌const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");


        Why we use it:
        📌Makes code more readable & declarative.
        📌Looks like HTML, so easier for developers to understand.
        📌Helps detect errors during compilation.
        📌Ultimately compiles into JavaScript objects (React.createElement) behind the scenes.

| Day 2: Components |
--------------------

Topics:
    🔹Functional vs Class Components
        1.Functional Component
            👉 A simple JavaScript function that takes props as input and returns JSX (UI).
            After React v16.8, functional components became powerful because of Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.).
            Now they can manage state and lifecycle like class components.

            ✅ Features:
            1.Easy to write, short & clean
            2.Uses Hooks for state and lifecycle
            3.Lightweight → better performance

        2.Class Component
             👉 A JavaScript class that extends React.Component and has a render() method that returns JSX.
                Class components were the only way to manage state and lifecycle methods before Hooks.
    
                ✅ Features:
                1.More boilerplate code
                2.Uses this.state and lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, etc.)
                3.Heavier due to class instantiation

        // Comparison Table:            

        | Feature               | Functional Components                          | Class Components                               |
        | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
        | **Definition**        | JavaScript functions that return JSX.          | ES6 classes that extend React.Component.       |
        | **State Management**  | Use Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)          | Use this.state and lifecycle methods.          |
        | **Lifecycle Methods** | Use useEffect Hook for side effects.           | Have built-in lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, etc.). |
        | **Syntax**            | Simpler and more concise.                      | More verbose due to class syntax.              |
        | **Performance**       | Generally faster due to less overhead.         | Slightly slower due to class instantiation.    |
        | **'this' Keyword**    | No 'this' keyword; uses closures.              | Uses 'this' to access props and state.         |
        | **Hooks Support**     | Fully supports Hooks for state and side effects.| Does not support Hooks; relies on lifecycle methods. |



    🔹Props vs State
        1.Props (Properties)
        Definition: Props are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.
        📌They are like function arguments.
        📌Cannot be changed by the child.
        📌Used to pass data and configuration.


        2.State
        Definition: State is a component’s own data storage that can change over time.
        📌Managed inside the component.
        📌Can be updated with useState (functional) or this.setState (class).
        📌Used for dynamic and interactive UI.

    🔹Rendering Elements
    Rendering elements means displaying UI on the screen using React elements.
    A React element is the smallest building block of a React app (like a virtual DOM node).
